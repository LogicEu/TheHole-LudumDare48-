# TheHole-LudumDare48-
A retro arcade 2D platformer game created in 48hrs from absolute scratch in C and OpenGL for the Ludum Dare 48 Game Jam.

Controls:
  - Arrow Keys or WASD: Move
  - M: Mute
  - R: Restart
  - Esc: Exit game

This projects was developed for MacOS, but uses platform independent libraries, so it shouldn't be so difficult to compile for other OS's. I will upload a shell script for Linux soon.

To compile, open the master folder in a terminal and run the shell script:
```shell
$ ./shell.sh comp
```

After compiling, execute from the script or directly.
```shell
$ ./shell.sh exe
$ ./TheHole 
```

The 'run' command allows you to do both.
```shell
$ ./shell.sh run
```

The 'macos_bundle.sh' script builds the app bundle directory to run as a MacOS Application.
```shell
$ ./macos_bundle.sh
```

I hope this project will allow someone to learn something.
:)
